# Möbius Prototype

Möbius Prototype is no longer under development. It is maintained here for historical purposes. 

Möbius Prototype tested out the key computational thinking and modelling ideas that were later included in Möbius Geospatial and Möbius Parametric.

## ViziCities Integration

The Modeller also included the [ViziCities](http://ww.vizicities.com/) viewer, developed by Paul Waddell and his team at UC Berkeley. The image below shows the ViziCities viewer integrated into Möbius. The procedure shown on the right loops through the 2D building polygons and adds height information. ViziCities is then use to extrude and render the models.
