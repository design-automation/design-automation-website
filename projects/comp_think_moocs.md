## Research Overview

Spatial Computational Thinking is increasingly being recognised as a fundamental method for various
spatial disciplines. It involves idea formulation, algorithm development, solution exploration, with
a focus on the manipulation of geometric and semantic datasets. 

This project developed a Professional Certificate Program on the Edx platform, delivering the
theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for leveraging computation for the manipulation
of various types of spatial data. 

All the courses use a browser-based software for write algorithms for generating and visualizing 3D
models, called MÃ¶bius Modeller. The programming language uses a visual programming approach
combining flowcharts with procedural programming. This will allow learners to quickly learn the
knowledge and skills required for writing computational procedures for generating, analysing, and
visualizing complex 3D spatial data sets. The programming knowledge is gained is highly transferable
to other languages such as Python or Javascript. 

## Professional Certificate Programme

In the first and second iterations, a Professional Certificate Programme was created, consisting of
four course:

- Professional Certificate Programme in Spatial Computational Thinking
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Procedural Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Semantic Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Generative Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Performative Modelling

Each course consisted of 4 weeks of lectures and exercises, covering both theoretical knowledge
and practical skills. Each week also included graded quizzes and coding assignments. In total, for
all four courses, the content included:

- 160 lectures
- 80 coding and modelling demonstrations
- 16 coding tutorials, with step-by-step videos
- 16 graded quizzes
- 16 graded coding exercises

### First Iteration

In the first iteration, from Jan 2020 to Apr 2020, the four courses were delivered as
**instructor-led**. This meant that each week, course content was released. Learners would follow
the courses, in a synchronous manner.

### Second Iteration

In the second iteration, from Sep 2020 to Feb 2021, the four courses were delivered as
**self-paced**. This meant that learners would follow the courses at their own pace, in an
asynchronous manner.

### Third Iteration

In the third iteration, from Sep 2021 to Feb 2022, the content was re-structured nto three courses.
The four courses were delivered as **self-paced**.
