# Spatial Computational Thinking

- Title: Spatial Computational Thinking: Edx Massive Open Online Courses
- Project Period: Apr 2019 to Sep 2020
- Funding Source: NUS LIFT
- Principal Investigator: Patrick Janssen (PI)
- Budget: SGD $67,000

## Research Overview

Spatial Computational Thinking is increasingly being recognised as a fundamental method for various
spatial disciplines. It involves idea formulation, algorithm development, solution exploration, with
a focus on the manipulation of geometric and semantic datasets. 

This project developed a Professional Certificate Program on the Edx platform, delivering the
theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for leveraging computation for the manipulation
of various types of spatial data. 

All the courses use a free and easy to use browser-based software for write algorithms for
generating and visualizing 3D models, called Möbius Modeller. The programming language uses a visual
programming approach combining flowcharts with procedural programming. This will allow learners to
quickly learn the knowledge and skills required for writing computational procedures for generating,
analysing, and visualizing complex 3D spatial data sets. The programming knowledge is gained is
highly transferable to other languages such as Python or Javascript. 

To begin with, the program helps learners get familiar with the fundamentals of computer
programming. Subsequently, with the help of a web application - Möbius Modeller, the learners will
be able to write computational procedures which can generate, visualize and assess 3D models. In
this program, Möbius instances are embedded within the tutorial and assignment pages. This will
guide learners to follow computational subjects with ease. 

## Professional Certificate Programme

In the first and second iterations, a Professional Certificate Programme was created, consisting of
four course:

- Professional Certificate Programme in Spatial Computational Thinking
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Procedural Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Semantic Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Generative Modelling
  - Spatial Computational Thinking: Performative Modelling

### First Iteration

In the first iteration, from Jan 2020 to Apr 2020, the four courses were delivered as
**instructor-led**. This meant that each week, course content was released. Learners would follow
the courses, in a synchronous manner.

### Second Iteration

In the first iteration, from Sep 2020 to Feb 2021, the four courses were delivered as
**self-paced**. This meant that learners would follow the courses at their own pace, in an
asynchronous manner.

### Third Iteration

In the third iteration, the content was re-structured nto three courses. The four courses were
delivered as **self-paced**.
