## Research Overview

The research aims to develop tools and methods that leverage Virtual Reality (VR) to improve spatial
understanding. The tools and methods will allow designers to iteratively generate and evaluate 3D
models using immersive VR with Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). 

The designers will define computational procedures (using Möbius Modeller) to generate models that
are VR enabled. Designers will then be able to view these models in a custom viewer. The process is
highly iterative, so designers will be continuously and rapidly switching from writing computational
procedures, generating 3D models, and evaluating 3D models in immersive VR.

Three specific VR capabilities have been identified: 

1) LOD: Generation of VR content at a minimal level of detail (including textures and imported
   objects, such as people, trees, cars etc). 
2) Interactivity: Interaction in the VR environment, including movement and navigation (walking,
   running, flying, and teleporting). 
3) Sensory Experience: Inclusion of sensory data into the VR environment (360 images and audio
   recordings).

The overarching research goal is to discover an effective set of VR capabilities for improving
spatial understanding.

## VR Viewer in Möbius Modeller

The VR Viewer has been implemented in [version 0.8 of Möbius Modeller](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/).
