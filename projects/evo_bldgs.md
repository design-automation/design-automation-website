# Evolving Buildings

- Title: Designing Sustainable Building Using Evolutionary Optimization Systems
- Project Period: 1 December 2008 to 30 November 2011
- Funding Source: MOE Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 1
- Principal Investigator: Patrick Janssen (PI)
- Budget: SGD $148,632.95

## Research Overview

The research developed an evolutionary developmental design method, called ‘Evo-Devo-Design’, as well as a supporting computational environment for executing population-based algorithms, called ‘Dexen’.

## Research Outcomes

Key research outcomes include the following:

- The development of the Evo-Devo Design method, defining how designers can encode their design
  schema as a set of computational procedures, thereby avoiding the need to write any code. These
  schema procedures define key aspects of the project: the type of brief and site, the criteria for
  optimization, and an adaptable design model. 

- The development of encoding schema for the evolutionary procedures, so that they can be uploaded
  into the evolutionary system allowing a population of optimized design to be evolved and explored.
  For this research, a Visual Dataflow Modelling software called Sidefx Houdini was used. The Figure
  above shows such an evolutionary optimization process being conducted for a residential housing
  development. 

- The development of the [Dexen system](/software/Dexen), a Distribute Execution Environment that
  was developed to accelerate the process of evolving designs. Dexen allows users to run
  evolutionary jobs in parallel on multiple networks computers. Although Dexen was created to
  support the Evo-Devo Design method, it is in fact a highly generic environment that can be used to
  run a wide variety of population-based algorithms.

- A set of case studies showing how the Evo-Devo Design method can be used to evolve designs for
  buildings with multiple conflicting performance criteria.
